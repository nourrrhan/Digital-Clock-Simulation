# Digital-Clock-Simulation
This project is a digital clock integrated with an alarm feature, which can be activated based on our requirements.
To set the alarm, we simply need to specify the desired time for it to go off. Once the designated time is entered,
a distinct ring tone is emitted, alerting us of the specified time.
